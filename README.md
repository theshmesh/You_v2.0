# You_v2.0
Final project for CSE648 - PSOSM (Privacy and Security in Online Social Media) - Spring 2021 - Know how much of your personality you reveal.

Social media profiles help companies to build psychographics of potential customers and segment them for targeted marketing in a cost-effective way. This commodification of our personal data for profit-making is resulting in surveillance capitalism. The digital traces we leave can often be misused. Our social media profiles can be analyzed by companies to deny us job opportunities and discriminate against us when making decisions. You_v2.0 attempts to make you aware of how the public and big tech companies can perceive you based on your publicly available data. We then give you advice on how you can protect yourself from getting manipulated.
